SCENARIO 8: Comparative Analysis (Academic)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Goal: Compare all three algorithms
Cities: 8

Steps:
1. Create a specific pattern of 8 cities
2. Document their coordinates
3. Solve with each algorithm:
   a. Nearest Neighbor → Record time & distance
   b. Held-Karp       → Record time & distance
   c. Brute Force     → Record time & distance
4. Create a comparison table

Expected Results:
• Held-Karp and Brute Force: Same distance (optimal)
• Nearest Neighbor: Possibly suboptimal
• Time: NN < Held-Karp < Brute Force
